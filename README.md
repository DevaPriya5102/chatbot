# Chatbots Project

## Introduction
This project explores the development and optimization of chatbots using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
The primary focus is on crafting effective prompt templates and managing conversation histories to enhance the capabilities of chatbots in understanding and responding to user queries.
The aim is to improve the interactivity and accuracy of chatbots in various applications, ranging from customer service to interactive story-telling.

## Project Description
The `chatbots.ipynb` notebook within this repository is a detailed guide on building chatbots that can effectively manage a conversation history to maintain context and utilize carefully designed prompt templates
to produce relevant and engaging responses. The project integrates theoretical concepts with practical implementations, demonstrating the impact of structured prompts and historical data management on the 
performance of conversational agents.

### Key Concepts Covered
- **Prompt Templates**: Designing prompts that guide the chatbot's responses, making them more contextually appropriate and user-centric.
- **Managing Conversation History**: Implementing techniques to store and refer back to previous parts of the conversation, allowing the chatbot to maintain context over longer interactions.
